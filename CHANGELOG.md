# Changelog

## v0.7.0 (2026-03-11)

Major release with native tool calling, mission system, TUI, permissions, and extensive UI improvements.

### Added

- **Native tool calling** — models use structured function calling (OpenAI, Ollama) instead of JSON-in-text. Default for all providers; falls back gracefully for legacy models.
- **TUI interface** — full terminal UI via ratatui. Default mode runs TUI + embedded server; `--web` for web-only.
- **Mission system** — agents self-initiate work on cron schedules when a mission is active. Idle scheduler prompts agents between user messages.
- **Plan mode** — agents can enter plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) for research and structured planning before making changes. Plans require user approval via `ExitPlanMode`.
- **File-scoped permissions** — `AcceptEdits` mode, deny rules, and per-project permission persistence.
- **Credential storage** — secure API key management via `/api/credentials` endpoint.
- **Model auto-fallback** — health tracking with automatic fallback to next model in the routing chain on errors or rate limits.
- **AskUser bridge** — agents can ask structured questions mid-run with options and multi-select.
- **Web search & fetch** — `WebSearch` (DuckDuckGo) and `WebFetch` tools for agents.
- **Skills marketplace** — search, install, and manage community skills from the web UI or CLI (`ling skills add/remove/search`).
- **`ling init` command** — scaffolds `~/.linggen/` directory tree, installs default agents, creates config, downloads skills.
- **`ling auth` command** — ChatGPT OAuth authentication (browser and device code flows).
- **Session-scoped SSE** — events are tagged with session ID; clients filter to their own session.
- **Per-session working directory** — `cd` in one session doesn't affect others.
- **SSE reconnect handling** — automatic state resync on reconnect with UI indicator.
- **Context window management** — adaptive compaction with importance-based message pruning.
- **Prompt caching** — stable system prompt prefix cached across iterations.

### Changed

- Config file renamed from `linggen.toml` to `linggen.runtime.toml`.
- Prompt system refactored from hardcoded strings to TOML templates.
- Tool calls render as individual inline widgets (aligned with Claude Code style).
- `ChatPanel.tsx` refactored into focused modules under `chat/` folder.
- `tools.rs` and `app.rs` split into module directories for maintainability.
- Default `supports_tools` changed to `true` even for unrecognized model IDs (prevents fallback to text-based JSON mode).

### Fixed

- SSE session isolation — events no longer leak across sessions.
- Streamed text-only responses no longer disappear after generation.
- Ollama 500 error — use role `"tool"` for tool result messages in native mode.
- Agent context loss on long conversations.
- Glob pattern matching edge cases.
- Queued message display order (now chronological).
- Think tag stripping for models that emit `<think>` blocks.
